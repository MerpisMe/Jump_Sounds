# Jump Sounds

This simple mod adds in the Jumping and Landing sounds from Bedrock Edition using a 100% modded block compatible implementation!

## Adding Custom Jumping Sounds

It's as simple as modifying the vanilla "fall" sound event for each respective block- that is, creating a sounds.json file and *replacing* the vanilla fall sound event through it.
